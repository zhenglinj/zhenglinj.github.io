THE MARVEL’S SUPERHEROES

Background

I still remember that I watched the movie Iron Man 1 during the summer holyday graduated from high school. It was so cool and amazing in my teenage also it deeply called my heroism.
General speaking, most of the boys imaged to be a superhero when they were teenage, since they have watched the superheroes’ movies. Like Marvel’s, DC’s movies.

Conclusions

At the same time, there are many superheroes in our Chinese movies. Like Jinyong’s heroes, Gulong’s heroes and so on.
For now, I got understand that we could never be a superhero as above, but we can be a good person in our daily life. As a man, we can be a girl’s hero to protect her. As a future father, we can be our familiars’ hero to protect members.
